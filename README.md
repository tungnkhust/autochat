# AutoChat: A Multi-Agent Framework built on AutoGen v0.4

This repository contains AutoChat, a framework built on top of AutoGen v0.4, simplifying the development of multi-agent applications.  AutoChat provides a standardized design for creating and managing agents, enabling easy collaboration and task delegation.  It leverages AutoGen-core 0.4 for its core functionalities.

## Core Concepts

AutoChat's design revolves around these key concepts:

* **Task Runners:** Individual processes responsible for executing specific tasks. Each task is handled by a dedicated task runner.

* **Agents:**  The intelligent entities performing tasks. Agents communicate and collaborate with each other via the agent runner.  There are different types of agents:
    * **Functional Agents:** Execute specific tasks based on their defined capabilities.
    * **Orchestrator Agents:** Manage and coordinate the execution of tasks by other agents.
    * **Proxy Agents:** Act as intermediaries between other agents or external systems.

* **Agent Runner:** The component managing communication and interaction between agents.

* **Groups:** Collections of agents working together on a related problem.  Groups define relationships and dependencies between agents.

* **Runner (Application Level):** The top-level application component that receives requests, interacts with agents and groups, and aggregates results.


## Framework Components

AutoChat simplifies multi-agent application development by providing these core components:

1. **Agent Definition:**  A standardized way to define agent capabilities, behaviors, and communication protocols.  This allows for easy creation and integration of new agents.

2. **Group Management:**  Tools for creating, managing, and monitoring groups of agents. This includes defining relationships and dependencies within groups.

3. **Agent Communication:**  A robust communication layer enabling seamless interaction between agents through the Agent Runner.

4. **Task Orchestration:** Mechanisms for efficiently distributing tasks among agents and managing their execution.

5. **Result Aggregation:** Functions for consolidating and presenting results from multiple agents.

## Getting Started

**(Instructions to be added here.  This section will contain details on installation, setup, usage examples, and running the example applications)**

1. **Installation:**  `pip install autochat` (This will need to be updated with the actual installation instructions once the package is created).

2. **Setup:**  [Instructions for configuring the framework and setting up agents and groups].

3. **Example Usage:**  [Examples demonstrating how to define agents, groups, tasks, and run the application].

4. **Running Tests:**  [Instructions for running the test suite].
